### Case:
e.g. CVSS 3.1 for CVE-2023-6711 \
Vulnerability #2 - ABB (CVE-2023-6711): \
The Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) being affected by this vulnerability resides in SuperEnergy Corp's test lab and is not deployed to production. \
The Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability requirements for the test RTU are low.

Additionally, the lab is firewalled from the rest of the network, so the Modified Attack Vector can be set as Adjacent, as an attacker would need to be connected to the lab network to exploit this vulnerability.

The overall Environmental Score is 4.1 (Medium), which is much lower than the base score, which reflects the fact this device is in a lab and is isolated from the rest of the network.

The CVSS 3.1 calculator was used to calculate an environmental score for this vulnerability. The environmental severity of this vulnerability is 4.1 (Medium).
