### SCADA systems
Often control critical infrastructure and can be targeted for sabotage or disruption.

### PLCs
computers used for automation of electromechanical processes, requiring high-reliability control, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis. PLCs are often targeted to disrupt manufacturing processes or cause physical damage.

### ICS 
Used to automate and control industrial processes. Integral to industries like energy, manufacturing, and transportation. ICS include DCS, HMIs. 

## DCS
Used to control processes within industrial plants or manufacturing facilities. They typically consist of multiple control elements distributed throughout the plant and are critical for the safe and efficient operation of the facility.
