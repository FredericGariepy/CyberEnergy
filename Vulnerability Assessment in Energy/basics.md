## Workflow
1. Identify vulnerabilities
2. Analyze vulnerabilities
3. Determine exploitability
4. Analyze Impact
5. Establish the Context
6. Prioritize Resolutions
7. Plan your Actions


#### Module Goals
**The only graded activity is the Report Assessment.** \
You will need to be able to complete an analysis of three vulnerabilities with reference to the following:
- Vulnerability Scan Report
- National Vulnerability Database (opens in a new tab)
- [Common Vulnerability Scoring System ](https://www.first.org/cvss/)(
- Vulnerability information from a vendor platform such as Tenable

Write a vulnerability assessment report based on the analysis of various security threats in the energy sector (SuperEnergy Corp., Power Pulse). \
The report evaluates the vulnerabilities identified from both an exploitability and impact perspective and recommends potential mitigation strategies.
