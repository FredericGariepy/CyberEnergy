Threat Environment is also called a *Threat Landscape Assessment.* \
It is a value-add to a cybersecurity risk assessment. The assessment reduces uncertainty and provides critical situational awareness of the shifting cybersecurity threat landscape while aiding in identifying probable threats and opportunities to reduce the risk of a real attack.

Assessing the threat landscape of an organization in the IT and OT field:
- Environmental scan and research
- Geopolitical and Regulatory Analysis

Steps:
1. Understand and Evaluate: e.g. [Cyber Center](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en)
2. Gather Threat Intelligence: e.g. [CISA alerts](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories)
3. Pay Attention to Similar Industries: e.g. [securityweek](https://www.securityweek.com/)
4. Evaluate Compliance Requirements
> Conduct an evaluation of adherence to relevant industry standards and regulatory requirements regularly.
>
> Some organizations may be subjected to specific requirements (e.g. NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection for organizations involved in transmission and generation, PIPEDA in Canada).
5. Conduct a Security Posture Review:
    - Conducting a review of the existing security measures and their effectiveness against known threats.
    - Use the [The Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) tool ](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/cybersecurity-capability-maturity-model-c2m2)
    - Or bring in a third party consulting organization to conduct a comprehensive assessment.

organizational profile :
- Nature and value of the data
- Past incidents 
- Industry-specific threats
- Cyber attack trends for profile

### Case example:
e.g. CVSS 3.1 for CVE-2023-6711 \
Vulnerability #2 - ABB (CVE-2023-6711): \
The Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) being affected by this vulnerability resides in SuperEnergy Corp's test lab and is not deployed to production. \
The Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability requirements for the test RTU are low.

Additionally, the lab is firewalled from the rest of the network, so the Modified Attack Vector can be set as Adjacent, as an attacker would need to be connected to the lab network to exploit this vulnerability.

The overall Environmental Score is 4.1 (Medium), which is much lower than the base score, which reflects the fact this device is in a lab and is isolated from the rest of the network.

The CVSS 3.1 calculator was used to calculate an environmental score for this vulnerability. The environmental severity of this vulnerability is 4.1 (Medium).
