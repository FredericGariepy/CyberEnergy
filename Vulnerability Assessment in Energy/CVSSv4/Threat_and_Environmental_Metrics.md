*Consumer side*

- The **Threat Metric** group reflects the characteristics of a **vulnerability that may change over time, but not across user environments.**

- The **Environmental Metric** group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are **relevant and unique to a particular user's
environment.**

- Threat metric
    - Exploit Maturity

## Threat Metrics - Exploit Maturity
current state of exploit techniques or code availability. Needs updates over time.

Is there Threat intel for the CVSS? \
*No/Undefined* \
IF yes, Public exploit or Concept code? \
*Neither/Unreported (U) <-- POC (P) --> Attacked (A)*

Not Defined (X) -  assume worst-case \
Attacked (A) - reported, exploit toolkit \
POC (P) - public, not attempted \
Unreported (U) - no knowledge

## Enviromental - Modified Base Metric and Safety
*consumer* adjustments depend on environment:
- firewalls
- network segmentation
- additonal safety features/policies
- Safety and Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- Potential downstream impact on Operational Technology (OT)

**Safety Values** : INJURY TO HUMANS
* *Safety value can ONLY be associated to Subsequent systems.*

IF major injury from exploit/ HUMAN LIFE IN DANGER, \
Modified Subsequent System (MS) integrity(I) and accesibility(A) are set to ***S***

### CIA Values
*Low/Limited adverse <-- Medium/serious adverse --> High catastrophic adverse*

Add CIA values to components in sytem such that CVSS vectors can effectively be intergrated for Triage.
