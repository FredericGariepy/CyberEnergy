# Base Metric Group
The Base Metric group represents the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across environments.
## Exploitability Metrics
#### Attack Vector - AV
*High <----> low* \
Network, Adjacent, Local, Physical
- Network: Exploit from remote network, internet or even *coporate intranet **!***
- Adjacent: Limited at protocol level, logicaly adjacent topology, Bluetooth, Wifi
- Local: local application, attacker can log in locally
- Physical: access to vuln. componnent.

#### Attack Complexity
Can attacker exploit vuln. at will? \
*No/High <----> Yes/Low*

*not a time measure* \
Conditions **beyond attacker's control**. \
Actions taken to circumvent Vulnerable systems':
- Address space layout randomization (ASLR)
- Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
- Built-in security enhancing features
- others.

#### Attack Requirements
Attack success depends on specific exec. conditions? \
*No/None <----> Yes/Present*

Attack success depends on presence of **specific deployment and execution conditions** in the vulnerable software.
e.g. : race conditions, network injection. 

#### Priviledges Required
Must attacker need auth? \
*No/None* \
IF yes, Admin priv. required? \
*No/Low <----> Yes/High*

#### User Interaction
Attack requires other user? \
*No/None* \
IF yes, other user **needs** to be active participant? \
*No/Passive <----> Yes/Active*

Passive UI e.g. : involuntary actions, malicious content on page when renderer. \
Active UI: user interact with payload, user subverts protection mechanism, malicious file upload

## Impact metrics (CIA) Vulnerable/Subsequent
disclosure, veracity, accessiblity 

- Confidentiality \
*No/None <-- Low (Some info/Attacker has no control over info degreee) --> High (all info/critical info)*

- Integrity \
*No/None <-- Low (some modify/Attacker has no control over kind or degree) --> High(modify rights/some critical)*

- Availability \
*No/None <-- Low (reduce performance/ non-crit/ intermittent op) --> High fucked, unavailable, serrious consequence*

- Safety: Exploit results in Safety impact
    - Not Defined (X)
    - Negligible (N)
    - Present (P)

- Automatable: automation of exploit across multiple targets? (recon, wepon, delivery, exploit: KILL CHAIN first 4)
    - Not Defined (X)
    - No(N)
    - Yes(Y)

- Recovery: resilience of component/system to recover after attack
    - Note Definied (X)

- Provider Urgency: is Supplier CVSS intergrated. "pass-through"
    - Red : High urgency
    - Amber : Moderate urgency
    - Green: Reduced urgency 
    - Clear: Low or No urgency

- Value Density: Resource Gain from attack
    - Not Defined (X)
    - Diffuse (D)
    - Concetrated (C)

- Vulnerability Responce Effort: Difficulty of *consumer* to provide inital response
    - Not defined (X)
    - Low (L)
    - Moderate (M)
    - High (H)
